# About
This is just a fun challenge... It originally started with NodeJS - I'm trying to recreate A.I without any documentation or videos of any kind to show me the way, I'm only allowed to use the limited knowledge I have on Neural Networks in actual brains and whatnot, it's been fun! I've been going ham on C language for the past week or 2 and I'm comfortable enough with it now to really move things along. As such I'm making it open source ^.^
